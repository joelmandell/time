  * Fixed so you cannot swap an time-item that is currently running.
  * Added some icons on the button to get away with clutter.
  * Aswell made the buttons go disabled for the previous item so you cannot start it by mistake, that would be a flaw by design.

  * Possibility to swap time-items on the fly in case of delays.
  * Hardcoded alarm notification when the time is up. This is going to be a configuration option later on.

  * Disable buttons when all time tasks are finished. This prevents the user from pushing a button, that will render in a crash.
    The buttons will only be enabled if the user triggers a function to restart the whole procedure!
