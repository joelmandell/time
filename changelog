  * The layout hindered the clock to update, because of the event listening event, but it is fixed now
    made an if statement to update the layout *only* if an change really was triggered!

100113:
  * Fixed time counting bug..before it was jumping to 1:01 after 0:59....but not anymore :)
  * Fixed layouting problem with the scrollbar area!
  * Made the time tracking process threaded!

100102:
  * Fixed scrollbar for the time items....so you can have alot of them now if you want to :]

  * Fixed so you cannot swap an time-item that is currently running.
  * Added some icons on the button to get away with clutter.
  * Aswell made the buttons go disabled for the previous item so you cannot start it by mistake, that would be a flaw by design.
  * Disable the mainwindow when the settings-window is launched.

091125:
  * Possibility to swap time-items on the fly in case of delays.
  * Hardcoded alarm notification when the time is up. This is going to be a configuration option later on.

091124:

  * Disable buttons when all time tasks are finished. This prevents the user from pushing a button, that will render in a crash.
    The buttons will only be enabled if the user triggers a function to restart the whole procedure!
